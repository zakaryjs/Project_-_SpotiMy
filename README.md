### - If a user is currently listening to a song, the message "<i>user</i> is listening right now!" will appear above the current album cover.
### - If a user changes the song they are listening to, the site will automatically update to reflect the change.
* #### <i>The change will be logged to the console.</i>
### - If a user is currently listening to a song, the album cover is clickable in order to open a new tab in the browser with more information about the song.
